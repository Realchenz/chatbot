    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "As you've observed, these two chunking schemes don't have a significant impact on the final results for the following reasons: 1. The context is relatively stable, meaning that even with different chunking schemes, most of the information can still be recognized and processed correctly. 2. Model robustness: Modern natural language processing models typically have a certain level of robustness, capable of handling different input forms to some extent. Therefore, even with different chunking schemes, the model is able to extract effective features to complete tasks. 3. Redundancy of features: In natural language processing tasks, multiple features are usually used to represent text, such as words themselves, parts of speech, syntactic structures, etc. Even if two different chunking schemes extract different features, some features may be redundant while others may complement each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps there are other methods to evaluate the impact of chunking that could be more effective. This evaluation was just a simple assessment."
